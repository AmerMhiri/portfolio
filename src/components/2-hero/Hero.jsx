        <p className='sub-title'>My name is Amer Mhiri, a 24-year-old from Sousse, Tunisia, with a diverse background and a passion for continuous growth.
           I bring 12 years of experience as a dedicated handball player, including 3 years with my first club and 2 years representing the national U19 team. 
           My career has also encompassed various customer-facing roles, such as working in a caf√© for 2 years, managing reception at a gym for 1 year,
            and serving as an animator in the hospitality industry for 4 years. Currently, I am embarking on new ventures as a fitness coach and web developer, 
            where I aim to combine my athletic experience and technical skills to inspire and innovate.
